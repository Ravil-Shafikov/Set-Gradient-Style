The plugin allows you to transfer the parameters of a new gradient to previously published styles, simplifying the process of manually transferring angles and breakpoints. This may be necessary if you need to update the current style, but doing it manually will cause.

1. Select a Frame, Rectangle or Vector with a new gradient
2. Write local style name which you want to update
3. Press "Set style"
